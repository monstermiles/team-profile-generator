      This app uses node and Inquirer to generate an HTML file that holds information about members of a development team.  When the app is run, the user choses which of three kinds of team members they want to add (manager, engineer, or intern), and is then prompted with a series of questions about each team member. The information the user inputs is then made into an html file and organized into easy-to-read cards for each employee.  
      
      Jest was used to test this application.  

      In the future, I would like to expand this app by storing the employee data in a SQL database, and use Express to add a server.


      ## Installation:
      Node.js is required to run this app. Once Node.js is installed, install the dependencies by running 'npm i' in the command line, and start the app by running 'node index.js'. 

      
      ## Usage:
      Just run node index.js and follow the prompts in the command line; putting in the necessary information at each step.


      ## Contributing:
      Send your ideas and input! 

      
      ## Testing:
      This app was tested durring development using Jest. The passing test files are in the application files in the 'test' folder.
